# PnetPhlix

## Functionality
PnetPhlix is a searching software that efficiently searches for a user in
in a database of 100k users and sorts through a database
of >20k movies in milliseconds to give a user personalized recommendations.

## Usage
Clone the repository, then unzip the file `movies_and_users.zip` to gain 
access the large `movies.txt` and `users.txt` files that will be turned into Movie and Users databases, respectively.
Inside the main.cpp file, you can use the 
Recommender class's API to make a recommendation based off of the user, 
printed out to the terminal.

## Learning
This project taught me a lot about how to design efficient programs. 
One change in an algorithm could merit drastic performance increases.
This also taught me a lot about data structures, and how they can be 
combined to make complex data easily searchable.
In addition, it helped me work through heavy pointer logic, Object 
Oriented Design, and debugging.
